"World of Zuul" is a * very simple, text based adventure game. *  * This class holds information about a command that was issued by the user. A * command currently consists of two strings: a command word and a second word * (for example, if the command was "take map", then the two strings obviously * are "take" and "map"). *  * The way this is used is: Commands are already checked for being valid command * words. If the user entered an invalid command (a word that is not known) then * the command word is <null>. * * If the command had only one word, then the second word is <null>. *  * @author Emir Zivcic * @version 2018-02-28 */public class Command {	protected String secondWord = null;	/**	 * Create a command object.
